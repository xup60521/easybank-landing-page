```bash
# install dependencies
pnpm install
# start dev server
pnpm run dev
```

## My process

### Built with

-   React (powered by vite)

-   TailwindCSS

-   framer-motion

### What I learned

#### Entrance animation

Itâ€™s not required, though. In order to make the page look prettier, I decided to implement the animation when entering the viewport.

`framer-motion` has a built-in solution.

```tsx
<motion.div
    initial={{ y: 20, opacity: 0 }}
    whileInView={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
    viewport={{ once: true }}
>
    {/* ... */}
</motion.div>
```

When the element enters the viewport, the animation triggers. In this case, it creates a fade-in animation in the upwards direction.
